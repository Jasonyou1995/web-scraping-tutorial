## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**Python Code:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include type hints where helpful
- Keep functions focused and small

```python
def extract_product_name(product_element: BeautifulSoup) -> str:
    """
    Extract product name from product element.
    
    Args:
        product_element: BeautifulSoup element containing product
        
    Returns:
        Product name as string
    """
    name_elem = product_element.find('h3', class_='product-name')
    return name_elem.get_text().strip() if name_elem else ""
```

**Markdown:**
- Use clear headings
- Include code blocks with language
- Add examples and screenshots
- Keep explanations concise
- Use bullet points for lists

### Adding Examples

When adding code examples:

1. **Include comments**
   ```python
   # Fetch the webpage
   response = requests.get(url)
   
   # Parse HTML content
   soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
   ```

2. **Make it runnable**
   - Include all imports
   - Provide sample data or URLs
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. **Keep it simple**
   - Focus on one concept
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Use realistic examples

4. **Test thoroughly**
   - Verify it works
   - Test edge cases
   - Check for errors

### Creating Exercises

Good exercises should:

1. **Build on tutorials**
   - Reinforce concepts taught
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Clear instructions

2. **Be achievable**
   - Appropriate for skill level
   - Reasonable scope
   - Provide hints if needed

3. **Include solutions**
   - Complete working code
   - Explanatory comments
   - Alternative approaches

Example exercise template:

```python
"""
Exercise: [Exercise Name]

TASK: [Clear description of what to build]

Instructions:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Expected Output:
[Show what the output should look like]

BONUS: [Optional challenge]
"""

# TODO: Your code here
