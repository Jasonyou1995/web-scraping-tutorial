## Ethical Scraping Guidelines

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Read and respect robots.txt
- Implement rate limiting (1-2 seconds between requests)
- Identify your bot with a proper User-Agent
- Handle errors gracefully without hammering the server
- Cache responses during development
- Only collect publicly available data
- Respect copyright and terms of service

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Scrape personal or sensitive data without permission
- Ignore robots.txt or rate limits
- Use scraped data for illegal purposes
- Overwhelm servers with rapid requests
- Bypass authentication or paywalls unethically
- Claim scraped content as your own

## Legal Resources

- [HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn) - Key legal case
- [GDPR Guidelines](https://gdpr.eu/) - European data protection
- [CCPA Information](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) - California privacy law

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Respect robots.txt
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Use configuration files
- [ ] Document your code
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Plan for maintenance
- [ ] Consider legal implications
- [ ] Set up alerts for failures
